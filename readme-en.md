# Manifesto

As Next Webber you are part of a broader community of designers, programmers, researchers and others who together ensure that the digital world also works for everyone. That is why we think it is essential that you share the same responsibility with us. We have drawn up a TNW manifesto that you can sign.

1. You make things that work for everyone Digital products only have value if they help people achieve their goals. That is why you are aware of the background, needs and goals of all the people for whom you make your products during every part of the process.
2. You value impact over form you understand how your project has a positive impact on the world and measure the success of your choices by how they increase them.
3. You dare to experiment Because you know the framework of your assignment, you are not afraid to explore the boundaries of what is possible within it. You dare to discover the unknown in order to look at the known in a new way.
4. You reflect on your work and yourself. What you add to the world largely depends on what you learn from your contributions. You take a critical look at your role, your work and how both have an impact on others. You actively look for ways to improve it.
5. You are part of an inclusive community You are part of a professional, open community that welcomes everyone. At the same time, your actions also reflect on this community - so you are aware that your personal choices can also have an impact on this community.

## Principles of the minor:

- Community-based learning. Our aim is to create a good learning organization together with a student in which knowledge is acquired and shared in a structured way.

- Iterative working and learning. We use an iterative process both when tackling projects and tackling the learning path. You work on multiple projects and you are allowed to experiment.

- Human-centered design. The design of products that solve a real problem for real people is central. During the semester you will try out your different products with the target group. You will also learn techniques to find out what the target group needs. The field of work is very important: you work for “real” clients, current techniques are used, you visit companies and you present your products to real users.

- Skills. In the semester you work on your skills in a structured way, you decide in consultation with us which skills you want to develop further and whether they fit well within the field of work.

# Minor structure

## Mini case (2x)
1. You will be assigned a random team
2. You get a short time to work out "case" (pressure cooker)
3. You work with supplied design research methodologies (framing, why how laddering, ideation)
4. You work human centered (interviews, observations, prototype testing)
5. As a group, you deliver a pitch with visual and interactive elaborations of your concept. (Figma, Sketch, Paper, Keynote)

## Thank God It's Friday (TGIF, continuous throughout period)

On every Friday you work on a small project. Within the next web world, working on side projects is seen as a good opportunity to gain new skills. Skills that you may need later in other projects. At the beginning of the semester, each student will have the opportunity to pitch an idea for TGIF. A typical TGIF project is small, a bit nerdy, a bit weird and inspiring to work on.

## Skill 'm all week
1. You consciously work on hard skills within the Next Web field (UX, UI, Typography, Programming, Sketching, Prototyping)
2. You visit companies
3. Possible guest lecture from experts and lecturers
4. You work individually and purposefully on your own skills and expertise
5. TGIF + Skill em all = love

## Assessment for learning
1. You will be individually assessed in 45 minutes on the basis of your account by two teachers.
2. You deliver your material on time and neatly
3. Logical candidates for this assessment are (Research, Create and Organize)

##Big Boss case
1. You work 10 / 12 weeks in a composed group on a project.
2. You work iteratively according to the SCRUM methodology on a product with a composed team.
3. Scouts are appointed who will explore assignments and put together the teams in collaboration with teachers.

## Assessment of learning
1. The session starts with a group presentation of 15 minutes with room for clarifying questions
2. You will be individually assessed in 30 minutes on the basis of your account by two teachers.

**If the material does not meet the eligibility criteria, it will not be processed.**

The language is on HBO. The report is written according to the APA standard. The various components must have a clear coherence. The golden rule is that teachers are **humans** and they don't have more than an hour to thoroughly review your material.

# Learning Outcomes

We assess on the basis of the learning outcomes, these are our assessment criteria.
These are drawn up from three levels, when assessing each competency, the four-eyes principle and the provision of appropriate evidence apply.


### To research
1. You research a given (well-defined) problem with the aid of methods provided for desk and field research. You involve the target group in this process. You formulate a practical solution based on the research results and the needs/interests/values ​​of the target group.

2. You explore a given (half-defined) problem. You place this in a broader context to better understand the unique context of the assignment. You choose a research method/format and you can substantiate this choice. You analyze the research results, being alert to the reliability and applicability of your insights; you use existing theory. You clarify the problem and formulate recommendations for possible solutions, taking into account various - sometimes contradictory - factors. You involve the various stakeholders in this process.

3. You identify a complex (undefined, possibly wicked) problem and develop a research direction. You interpret the different (conflicting) aspects, interests and values ​​in your research results. You work out the issue with a self-chosen mix of research methodologies. You develop a broad vision of the issue and the context in which it plays, and you place this in a social context. You work closely with the various stakeholders.

### To create
1. You design a suitable solution for a given (well-defined) problem. You regularly involve the target group in the creative process and make use of (provided) basic knowledge/skills. You base the solution on insights and examples from research. This produces a usable product, where you have adapted (core elements of) an existing idea to the application context. 

2. You design a well thought-out solution to a complicated problem. You regularly involve various stakeholders in the creation process and use extensive self-chosen and self-made professional knowledge and skills. You base the solution on insights and examples from research. This results in a product in which existing ideas are combined in their own way and their possible impact on the target group and its immediate environment is taken into account.

3. You design an inspiring solution to a complex (undefined, possibly wicked) problem with conflicting aspects. You continuously involve different stakeholders in the (co)creation process and make use of broadly integrated, general and specialist skills and expertise. You base the solution on insights from your own experiments and existing research. This results in a product in which these insights have been translated into something new in their own way, the social impact has been taken into account and the meaning extends beyond just the application context and/or that which is immediately experienced.

### To organize
1. You take responsibility for your own work and (partial) products. You look ahead to plan your own activities. You make a clear project schedule for your team and together with your teammates you make a division of tasks, whereby the various activities are interrelated. Because you monitor the overview, your team members can focus on their tasks. You help teammates with their planning, motivate them and address them if necessary. In addition, you monitor the atmosphere in - and the functioning of - the group and make any problems negotiable.

2. You have an eye for different talents within your team and use them to strengthen the work process and the result. You take care of the design of the work processes and a constructive atmosphere in the group. You create and monitor the overview. You are assertive when necessary, but leave responsibilities with the team members as much as possible. As a point of contact, you are well aware of what is happening in the group. You can respond to changing circumstances and take responsibility for adjustments in the planning (or hand over tasks to the right person). You take responsibility for your own work, but also for that of your teammates.

3. You take the lead in setting up, determining the working method and the mission and vision of a team. You make effective use of the (cultural) diversity within the group. You take (jointly) responsibility for your own work and that of others. You can assess work processes from different perspectives and choose the right interventions to optimize your own effectiveness and that of the group. You have an external focus, aimed at synergy with external parties. You anticipate changing circumstances and take appropriate action.

### To communicate
1. You have basic knowledge of (intercultural) communication. Based on this, you communicate specifically with a specific target group or stakeholder. You adapt your message in terms of form, tone and content and listen actively so that the message of both the sender and the receiver comes across as well (clear/correct/attractive) as possible.

2. You have nuanced knowledge of (intercultural) communication and you consciously choose the right approach based on this to systematically communicate with different target groups or stakeholders. This leads to a series of communications that are tailored to and/or a series of contact moments that are coordinated with the target group or stakeholders in order to achieve 'common ground' and/or an optimal product or commercial result.
3. You are sensitive to the interests and values ​​of the other person and can place them in a broader (cultural) context. Partly based on this, you develop an integrated communication strategy in which the right course is determined that should lead to a desired image among self-chosen target groups or stakeholders.

### To learn
You cannot choose this competency as an Optional Competency.

1. You set task goals and thus create pressure and support to motivate yourself. You choose a suitable time and place of learning. You ask for specific help in finding the right knowledge and skills and in assessing whether you have mastered them sufficiently. You monitor progress towards task goals, reflect on your actions and formulate points for improvement for the continuation of the learning process. Within a (multidisciplinary, diverse) team you can help peers and ask for help.

2. You learn application-oriented. You identify limitations in knowledge and skills (K&V) and set task and learning objectives. You specifically look for missing K&V and choose a learning strategy to master it effectively. You reflect on what and how you have learned. You assess whether you have sufficient command of the required K&V and you can ask for help with in-depth knowledge processing in order to apply it. In addition, you compare your own learning and work behavior with that of others and you become aware of your own comfort zone and what lies outside it. Within (multidisciplinary) teams you can effectively transfer K&S to your peers and vice versa. 

3. You learn from intrinsic motivation. You create a coherent set of learning objectives that match your interests and ambitions. You can process information in depth to make distant knowledge transfers. You look for sparring partners, other views and talents to enrich your self-knowledge, your vision and the way you and others learn and act. You reflect on what and how you have learned. You choose your own criteria and standards. You can direct the common learning process within (multidisciplinary, diverse) teams, creating a Community of Learning (COL)

## SHOW DON'T TELL

The 80/20 rule is a design principle that we love. But rather not a report that contains only 20% design and 80% description, but rather the other way around. So show your work and explain how it has contributed to your current level of awesomeness. We are ultimately a design school, not a writing school.

Show it off! Create Screencasts, screenshots, videos, complete the picture with a reflection in your account. Create a visual record of your GitHub Commits.

But do know that we are looking for substantiation, just sending hordes of pictures is not enough substantiation.

We'd love to see the work you've done for the group assignments and the communities of expertise, but side projects and your own work are also welcome. As long as you can use something for your own development, it is welcome at the assessment. Tip: don't make it a portfolio show. We like to see the good, the bad and the ugly.

**Plagiarism**

The reviewers assume that all documentation you submit has been written by you. You clearly indicate the use of external sources in the manner that is customary in APA. There is plagiarism if: You copy texts or parts of texts from others without citing the source

Copying your text structure without acknowledging the source For more information see 'How not to plagiarize': http://ombudsperson.utoronto.ca/reports/hownottoplagiarize.pdf. If plagiarism is involved, this will be submitted to the Board of Examiners. The Board of Examiners will make a decision in accordance with the Teaching and Examination Regulations (OER). The assessment for which the material has been submitted will be cancelled. Chance 1 has therefore not been used and the assessor will not assess the submission.

# The bill
An account contains in any case:

- An overview of requested ECs
- Learning objectives described using the [Learning Outcomes](#Learning Outcomes)
- References to evidence or blog to show where the growth is
- A concise reflection on the learning process for each requested competence


# House rules

**The room D2.036** is ours on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, again tidy and careful.

You are present every week. If you really cannot come, you must discuss this with the minor owner in good time; Absence outside the designated periods must be discussed with the minor owner; You will have to have a very good reason for absence if we want to take this into account, in connection with the continuous embedded assessment.

I design and program things, preferably for people, not surprisingly. Although designing for people often goes wrong, such as airplane seats that ultimately do not fit anyone or facial recognition software that is accidentally racist, so less easy than you think. As a teacher at the Creative Technology academy, I try to figure out with students how to design the right things. An always fresh combination of research, iterative work and above all a lot of making & trying seems to be the best strategy so far.

## Raymond van Dongelen

- [Blog](https://raymond.frl)

Programming is something I have always really enjoyed doing. After my computer science studies, I worked as a programmer for a number of years. In the field I got a bit frustrated about the bad products we made, why not take more into account the users of the product? Within education, I think it's extremely important that we bring together the different disciplines that are needed to make something cool, and ensure that they can work well together. To make a product that solves a problem, works well and is solidly put together. At the university of applied sciences I also work in the master Health innovation.

Available: Mon, Tue, Wed, Friday. But also responsibilities in the Health innovation master.

Expertise: Design science, Computer science
Background: HBO Computer Science at the NHL Hogeschool and Master Applied Communication Science University of Twente.
